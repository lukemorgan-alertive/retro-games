When we are creating templates that will render HTML, we need to ensure that considerations are made to prevent Cross-Site Scripting. This needs to cosnider all data that is rendered in the template. 

These should follow python templating best practices. Please also ensure we document any implemenations INLINE in the template using comments that WILL NOT be rendered with the HTML.

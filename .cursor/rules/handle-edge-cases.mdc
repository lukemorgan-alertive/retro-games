Identify potential edge cases in programming logic you are ADDING OR MODIFYING and IMPLEMENT further programming logic to handle these edge cases effectively. 

Consider scenarios such as boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and unexpected user behavior. Provide code examples where applicable to illustrate your solutions.

Where remedial actions are taken, ensure that they follow best practices for error handling and user feedback and DOCUMENT these changes INLINE with any remediations for the edge case.

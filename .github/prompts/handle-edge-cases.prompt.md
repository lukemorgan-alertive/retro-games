Identify potential edge cases in the project programming logic and IMPLEMENT programming logic to handle them effectively. 

Consider scenarios such as boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and unexpected user behavior. Provide code examples where applicable to illustrate your solutions.

Where remedial actions are taken, ensure that they follow best practices for error handling and user feedback and DOCUMENT these changes clearly WITH THE CODE that remediates the edge case.
